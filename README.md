## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Abdul Salam**, a results-driven **Mobile Application Developer** who bridges the gap between complex requirements and production-ready code. I specialize in building scalable mobile apps using **Flutter**, with a strong focus on State Management (**GetX**) and efficient API integration (**Dio**).

My competitive edge is my **AI-Augmented Workflow**. I leverage advanced LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude) to accelerate development, debug complex logic, and seamlessly integrate **PHP-based APIs** and **Firebase** backends. This allows me to deliver client projects faster and with cleaner architecture.

**Founder & Lead Developer** at [Bits Accurate](https://github.com/bitsaccuratestudio)  
**Tagline:** Accuracy in Software Development  
**Location:** India 🇮🇳  
**Open to:** Freelance Projects | Contract Work | Collaborations
